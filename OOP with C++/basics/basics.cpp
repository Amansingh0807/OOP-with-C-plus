// "\": The backslash (\) is an escape character in C++. When followed by certain characters, it alters the meaning of the character that follows it. Here, "\" is used to include a double quote `"` within a string literal.
// \\n: The backslash is also used here to escape the backslash itself (\\), followed by n. In this context, \\n is printed as the characters \ and n rather than being interpreted as a newline character.
